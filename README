This is a sample project to quickly get started
testing with JsUnit, JSMock, and Functional Javascript
based on the InfoQ article:
  * InfoQ: JavaScript Test Driven Development with JsUnit and JSMock -- http://www.infoq.com/articles/javascript-tdd

Bundled in this Git repo are: JsUnit (modified), JSMock, and Functional Javascript.
* See LICENSE for the detailed versions.



Modifications to the JsUnit:
1. Removal of the js-test-kit/test/javascripts/jsunit/java directory

This was done to limit the size of the js-test-kit as the java directory is not strictly needed.

2. Patched jsunit/app/jsUnitCore.js, and jsunit/app/jsUnitTestManager.js

These are patched to avoid issues in Firefox when the FireBug Add-on is installed.
See: js-test-kit/test/javascripts/JsUnit-FireBug.patch
